      "Trace the lines, add your own colours, and bring Abdullah & Fatima to life.",
    ways_to_use_activity:
      "Use this sheet as a calm, creative activity during or after story time. Children can trace the outlines slowly, then colour in the characters using pencils, crayons, or markers. It works well as a quiet-time task, a reward activity, or a warm-up before more structured learning.",
    skills_practiced:
      "Fine motor skills, pencil control, hand–eye coordination, focus, patience, creativity, and early pre-writing skills.",
    for_parents_teachers:
      "Encourage children to follow the outlines carefully, going slowly rather than rushing. You can talk about who Abdullah and Fatima are, what kind of day they might be having, and how they feel as children draw. Praise effort and perseverance instead of ‘perfect’ lines, and invite children to share something they like about their finished picture.",

    ways_to_use_activity:
      "Print and use this sheet as a follow-up to Part 1 or as a standalone creative task. Ask children to trace the outlines first, then shade, colour, or add patterns and backgrounds.

      "Fine motor control, visual perception, concentration, creativity, and confidence with drawing tools.",
    for_parents_teachers:
      "Invite children to notice shapes, lines, and details in the picture before they begin. You can model how to trace slowly and steadily. Use the moment to open gentle conversations about the characters’ emotions, manners, or actions, linking the activity back to Islamic values discussed in your lessons or family time.",
